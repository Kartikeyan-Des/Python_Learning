## My Python Learning Journey

I started this journey to master Python and leverage it as a foundation for working with Artificial Intelligence. AI is rapidly transforming industries, and  I’ve chosen to understand it, use it, and build with it.

My goal is to use AI as a tool to accelerate learning, solve real-world problems, and create impactful applications. This repository documents my progress, experiments, and projects as I grow into the AI space.
