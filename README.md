## My Python Learning Journey

I started this journey to master Python and leverage it as a foundation for working with Artificial Intelligence. AI is rapidly transforming industries, and  I’ve chosen to understand it, use it, and build with it.

My goal is to use AI as a tool to accelerate learning, solve real-world problems, and create impactful applications. This repository documents my progress, experiments, and projects as I grow into the AI space.

## 🛠️ Completed: Week 1 Foundation (Feb 11 - Feb 23 (2026))
I have successfully mastered the core logical building blocks of Python.

### Key Skills Mastered:
- **Control Flow:** Mastering `if/else` and `while/for` loops for decision making.
- **Data Structures:** Implementing Lists and Dictionaries to manage complex datasets.
- **Functional Programming:** Building reusable code blocks with `def` and `return`.
- **State Management:** Tracking variables and user input across an interactive session.

### 📂 Featured Projects:
- **[Number Guessing Game](./guessgame.py):** A logic-based game utilizing the `random` module and `while` loops.
- **[Student Management System](./dict.py/):** A real-world application using **Lists of Dictionaries** to store and retrieve data.
- **[Modular Calculator](./functions.py/):** A project focused on logic separation and functional return values.
